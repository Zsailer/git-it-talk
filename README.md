# Collaborating on Code

These [slides](https://zsailer.github.io/git-it-talk/) are from a two hour tutorial I have to Master's students in Bioinformatics at University of Oregon.
It was meant to be a beginners primer to Git and Github.

If you find these useful for teaching, please use them and let me know on Twitter ([@zrsailer](https://twitter.com/zrsailer))! I would love any feedback. Feel free to open an issue if you'd like to see anything added (or if you find typos). Even better, open a PR with new slides!

# The goal

The goal of the lesson is to learn how to collaborate on a software project.

Students learn:

1. to initialize their first Git repository (project)
2. branch, commit, and merge branches locally.
2. create a remote repository on Github
3. push their git project to Github
4. fork an existing project
5. clone existing project locally, branch, and submit new pull request
